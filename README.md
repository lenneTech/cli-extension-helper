# CLI Helper Package

The [lenne.Tech](https://github.com/lenneTech) CLI Helper Package helps to initialize your next [CLI](https://github.com/lenneTech/cli-starter) project extremely fast.
For example, it is ideal for creating a new npm package.

## Requirements

- [Node.js incl. npm](https://nodejs.org):
  the runtime environment for your TypeScript project

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git):
  the version control system for your source code

## Update packages

For regular control and easy update of new npm packages you can use e.g. [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates).

## Alternative recommendations for specific purposes

### Create a new CLI or shell script

For the creation of a new CLI or a shell script we recommend [Gluegun](https://github.com/infinitered/gluegun).

A corresponding starter is currently under development and will be linked here as soon as it is ready.

### Create a new server

So that you can quickly set up a server with database connection and GraphQL API via [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), we have developed the lenne.Tech [Nest Server Starter](https://github.com/lenneTech/nest-server-starter) for you.
